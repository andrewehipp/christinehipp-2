# Starter 2


# Running

To run use `npm run build` or `npm run watch`. If you prefer gulp you can use `gulp` and `gulp watch` instead. Developers can copy this workflow into `rg-harbinger-starter-2`.

# Dist

Assets used by the site.

### Images

The project's images directory has several starting folders based on common uses. Alter the folder structure at any time to provide better project organization.

* `content`: Editorial or content images. Not part of the styling or theming of the site.
* `global`: Images `global.css` uses or relies on.
* `meta`: Images used by the site's meta tags or sharing.
